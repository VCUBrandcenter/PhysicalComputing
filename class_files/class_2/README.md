# Tips:
* For the basic serial example, you don't need any wiring.
* The potentiometers in these examples are wired so that turning them clockwise will increase the value being received by the arduino. If you want to reverse that, swap the ground and power wire coming into the potentiometer.
* Capacitors are great for quickly storing and releasing energy so that when things like servos require extra juice, it won't pull down the power on the board. But remember, __always wire the negative side to the ground and the positive side to the power wire. If wired incorrectly, capacitors can explode.__ This is why capacitors are clearly marked on the side, which end is negative.
